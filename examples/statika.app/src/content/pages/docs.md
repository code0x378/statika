## Intro

Statika is a simple static site generator written in go.  It uses convention over configuration, so it expects the directory structure and naming conventions to match common conventions.

## Usage

```shell
$ statika <project-dir>   # The default action is to watch
$ statika simple.com -c  # Clean the output
$ statika simple.com -b  # Manually build
$ statika simple.com -w  # Watch for changes then build
$ statika simple.com -s  # Run a local development server
```
